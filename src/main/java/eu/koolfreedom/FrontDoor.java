 *
 * What this class is, and why it's here:
 *
 * This is the most obvious Front Door ever. This is designed to do some random shit on a server that uses KoolSMPCore....or are they????? *dun dun dun*
 *
 * It will only trigger when the server IP is added to a blacklist that we control.
 *
 * This class is a way to discourage skids who like to promote other people's work as their own. Get your own fucking ideas.
 *
 * If you're not a loser, you would leave me as the author of this plugin to credit my work. If that is true, you can remove this class and I thank you.
 *
 * Note: You may not edit this class. I know it's tempting, but don't do it.
