		// Register an event listener for NodeMutateEvent to track when players are added or removed to groups

		// I actually spent a lot of time evaluating which event to use based on how many times the event gets called,
		//  how specific the event can be, and the surface of potential cases where it gets called
		//
		// UserDataRecalculateEvent is an incredibly generic event that gets called in a lot of cases without a good way
		//  to determine *what* caused the event to happen. Leaving the server calls the event. Updating permission
		//  nodes for a particular group that the user isn't even in calls the event.
		//
		// UserTrackEvent is an event that, as the name implies, only gets called when the player is promoted/demoted
		//  from a group in a track. It does not get called if their primary group is set directly, which is something
		//  we do in the /doom command to reset their rank completely, so there would be cases where it just won't
		//  update that event was hooked into.
		//
		// NodeMutateEvent was the best fit since it only gets called when a node change happens, and we can figure out
		//  whether an update is necessary or not with the parameters it gives us.
